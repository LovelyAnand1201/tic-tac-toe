<h1> The tic tac toe Game </h1>
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or X's and O's, is a simple yet classic game usually played by two players. 
  It is a paper-and-pencil game that has been popular for generations. In this project, I have tried to make a digital version of this classic game.</p>
